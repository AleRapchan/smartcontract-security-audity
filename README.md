# Smart Contract Security Audity
Smart contract security auditing is a thorough analysis of a blockchain applicationsâ€™ smart contracts in order to correct design issues, errors in the code, or security vulnerabilities.
- An assessment of your secure development process.
- The best option available to identify subtle vulnerabilities
- A systematic method for assessing the quality and security of code.

### ANALYZE SECURITY VULNERABILITIES PROCESS INVOLVES:
- Analyze specifications
- Run tests
- Run automated analysis tools
- Perform manual code audit
- Create audit report

## ETHEREUM SECURITY CHALLENGES :
- Decentralized execution environment
- New software stack
- Very limited ability to patch contracts
- Anonymous financially motivated attackers
- Rapid pace of development
- Suboptimal high-level language

## CLASSIFICATION OF ISSUES IN SOLIDITY CODE :
- `Security` : directly lead to exploits
- `Functional`: violate the intended functionality1
- `Operational` : lead to run-time problems
- `Developmental` : make code hard to improve

## TYPICAL ISSUES IN SOLIDITY CODE
- Re-entrancy (security)
- Locked money (functional)
- Costly loop (operational)
